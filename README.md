# Project-Management-Project
Our project is to design, build, and test a functional prototype of an autonomous baby crib mobile that slowly spins and plays music. The engineering team is responsible for designing, building, and testing the product while the project management team is responsible for creating project-related collateral to assist in managing the project.
